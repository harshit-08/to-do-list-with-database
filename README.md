You can use the app from this link.-->
https://glacial-savannah-93841.herokuapp.com/     

By default the list is for Today(the day you are using it).

To make a new list you can just type the name of that list after the link.

For example, to make a new Work list just add "Work" after https://glacial-savannah-93841.herokuapp.com/.

So it will become https://glacial-savannah-93841.herokuapp.com/Work.

Now you can easily navogate through different lists just by typing the name of that list after the base URL(https://glacial-savannah-93841.herokuapp.com/).

ENJOY!
